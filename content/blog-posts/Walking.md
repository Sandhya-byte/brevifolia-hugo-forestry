Insurance is the common lingo nowadays especially for two wheelers, given the recent regulations. We all have the common knowledge that insurance helps us to cover the financial losses in case of any untoward happening in our lives like accidents, theft and so on.

But the question **what is insurance** kept going on a loop in my mind? So, this post is inspired by that thought.

As per the dictionary and many other websites, Insurance is legal document that binds an insurance company to cover the financial losses arising from any accidents if (pay attention here) the person pays the premium amount correctly.

## Now, as we have established what is insurance is, let us the see about the players involved!

The scene of Act One has three characters:

*  The insurance policy,
* The insurer and
*  The insured.

The insurance policy is the legal document that holds all the terms and conditions of the contract. It also includes the circumstances under which the financial settlement would be paid to the insurer or their nominees.

The insurer is the company that agrees to compensate in the event of an unfortunate happening.

The insured is the person who enters into the contract with the insurance company.

Next is the question is the most obvious one:

# How does insurance work?

As insurance policy is a contract that helps you protect you and your family in case of accidents. However, if you notice we see that the insurance paid towards the insurance policy is quite less even when the amount insured is huge.

That is because, not every insured party claims their damages(they do live a hearty and healthy life, so no insurance).

Furthermore, any person is free to approach any insurance provider, they feel to be the best in the market for insurance. This principle applies inversely to insurance companies, because they filter out their applicants. In a way, you can compare to the process of seeking admission for your kid at school. Oh, the joys of parenting!

## Next in the series would be the type of insurance available in the market:

Well, when looking at the **type of insurance** we require, there are so many kinds prompting us to reach out an oxygen mask (beware, even that comes under insurance)
